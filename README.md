NASA NEO Data Analysis

## 🚀 Overview

Near-Earth Objects are asteroids and comets with orbits that bring them close to Earth. This project aims to:

* Collect NEO data using NASA's open API
* Analyze trends in NEO characteristics such as size, speed, and distance
* Identify potentially hazardous asteroids
* Visualize NEO activity over time

## 🧰 Features

* ✅ Fetch NEO data from NASA API
* 📊 Time series and trend analysis
* 🛰️ Highlight close approaches to Earth
* 🧠 (Optional) Predictive modeling of NEO behavior

## 📦 Installation



1. Set up your NASA API key:

   * Obtain a free API key from: [https://api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov)
   * Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

     ```
     NASA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## 📈 Example Visualizations

* Daily counts of NEOs
* Size distribution of NEOs
* Close approach timelines

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
